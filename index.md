### Project Description
The main objective of this platform is to create a jobverz portal for the user who are more focused for a skill-based job. This feature is mainly helpful for the Individuals, Employees/Company and Governments. My basic functionality is used to create a front-end development where any person can visit their website with basic credentials.

2. As a part of extracting the data, we have done some research and tried to use third-party libraries like resume-parser and pyreparser.
3. Tried using NLP for skills extraction with 70-80% of accuracy.
